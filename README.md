gateway-rewrite
===============

Node.js middleware to execute CGI scripts with URL rewriting

/(Modified from gateway by Felix Gnass and added url rewriting capabilities)/

Purpose of this module is to allow development tools like
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) or [Livestyle](https://github.com/One-com/livestyle)
to serve PHP files (and possibly other scripting languages) directly, simulating apache url rewriting.
This is particularly useful when using PHP and Slim library in company with grunt-server


To make this work you need the `php-cgi` binaray in your PATH.

## Usage

```javascript
var http = require('http');
var gateway_rw = require('gateway-rewrite');

var rwGateway = function (dir){
    return gateway_rw(require('path').resolve(dir), {
        rules: [
            {
                rule: '^(/api/.+)',
                cgi:  '/usr/bin/php-cgi',
                to:   '/api/index.php'
            },

            /* Use the following options to match the base path. */
            {
                rule: '^/$',
                cgi:  '/usr/local/opt/php54/bin/php-cgi',
                to:   '/index.php'
            }
        ]}
    );
};



    grunt.initConfig({

        (more here)

        connect: {
            options: {
                hostname: 'localhost',
                port: 9000
            },
            livereload: {
                options: {
                    middleware: function (connect, options) {
                        return [
                            /* Let's see if the rule matches something to rewrite */
                            rwGateway(sysConfig.build_dir),
                            /* Otherwise it's a static file */
                            mountFolder(connect, sysConfig.build_dir)
                        ];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        (even more grunt options here)

    });


```

## Installing php-cgi

My preferred way is to use APT and install the php5-cgi package.

Alternatively, the `php-cgi` binary can be installed via Homebrew by tapping the
[homebrew-php](https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php) repository:

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew tap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    brew install php54


## Directories

if the request URI matches the regular expression *rule*, then the *cgi* binary is used
rewriting to the PHP file in the *to* option.

The *rules* option is an array so you can add as many rewrite rules you need.
